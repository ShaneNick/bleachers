#Description

In its simplest form, "Bleachers" is a web app that users can login into and create chat rooms to discuss current sport matches.

Our motivation behind "Bleachers" was to see if we could create a full stack web app using socket.io that allowed for chat rooms to be created. We continued to brainstorm what these chat rooms would be used for and we landed
on it being used for discussing sport matches. As a group we decided to tackle this challenge since it would provide a great learning experience. Before starting this project none of us knew what socket.io was but the idea
of creating chat rooms piqued our interest. The socket.io documentation and other resources online provided a lot of help in the creation of this project. 

Although there are many choices people can choose from (e.g. Reddit, Twitter, Facebook, etc.) to discuss these topics, we think this project is setting the foundation for a fresh new idea. We are excited to continue learning
and building out this project. It is still in early development but keep an eye out!
